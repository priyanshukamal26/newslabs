# NewsLabs

## Project Info

NewsLabs is an AI-powered news aggregator designed to unclutter your information diet. 

**Motive:**
In a world of information overload, NewsLabs uses local AI (Ollama/Llama3) to:
1.  **Ingest** RSS feeds from various sources.
2.  **Analyze** each article for relevance and key insights.
3.  **Summarize** content into digestible formats (2-sentence summaries, bulleted insights).
4.  **Chat** with your news feed to ask questions and get deeper context.

It transforms raw news streams into a personalized, high-signal intelligence feed.
